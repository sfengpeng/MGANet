This repository is for the paper "Multi-Granularity Aggregation Network for Remote Sensing Few-Shot Segmentation"

## Framework

![framework](C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\framework.png)



## Requirements

### Environment

```
git clone https://github.com/sfengpeng/MGANet.git
cd MGANet

conda create -n MGANet python=3.9
conda activate MGANet

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset and Weights

Download the datasets from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NjZxFxLCNcaTCu_uQO8NNA?pwd=2f3y) and the put them in the data directory.

```
MGANet
└─data
    └─iSAID
        └─train
        └─val
    └─LoveDA
    	└─train
    	└─val
```



Download the ImageNet pretrained backbone from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1l9CPkmP69sbxzUYUtwVISg?pwd=n314) and put them in the pretrained_model directory.

```
MGANet
└─pretrained_model
	└─resnet50_v2.pth
	└─....
```

We also provide the trained models weights for evaluation. [vgg16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SH3jOrV1zNyNJNyiEfPdNz7x7_7MWKjp/view?usp=drive_link),  [resnet50](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10W9SjQFjWVVF8JFTOypUaLSPMaNCirEl?usp=drive_link),  [resnet101](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QNhpuzppl699Y3GE4nQLXpTN03hDPy-7?usp=drive_link)

You need to pre-configure the script file with settings such as GPU, backbone network, and other parameters., and run the following code for training and testing:

```
bash train.sh
bash test.sh
```



## Non-BAM settings

 To switch to the non-BAM setting, simply copy the contents of `dataset-BAM.py` and replace the existing `dataset.py`

```
MGANet
└─utils
	└─dataset.py
	└─dataset-BAM.py

```
